# PAC-Bayes-Split-kl Inequality
This repository contains the code needed to replicate the experiment on linear classifiers in Sec. 4.1 in the preprint [1].

## Experiment Environment
The implementation is in R. The implementation are tested in Windows.

## Basic usage
Before running the experiments, change the path in the script to the local repository.
Also, change the [data_option] to one of the options listed behind. The data sets are from [3]. Output files will be created in directory `out/`.

## Plots
After running the experiments, the plots of the paper can be generated by `cd`ing to the `plots` directory and running:`make plot`. Output figures will be generated in the subdirectories `figure`.

## Acknowledgements
Some of the implementations in `script`, `gen-data`, and `PBUB` are based on the implementation from [2].
