# Split-kl Inequality
This repository contains the code needed to replicate the experiments of numerical studies of split-kl in Sec. 2.3 and Appendix D in the preprint [1].

## Experiment Environment
The implementation is in Python 3 and tested in Linux.

## Basic usage
The simulation and be run as follows:
- For ternary random variables: make sim_ternary
- For bounded random variables: make sim_bounded

## Plots
After running the experiments, the plots of the paper are generated under the `plots` directory.
